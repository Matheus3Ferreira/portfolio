## Why I made this?

Because I challenge me a lot of times to make a project, but I didn't have any idea what to do, so, I m ake this simple website, to show what I like to do. I'm learning about development frontend and backend, and english too, and this was a challenge for me to learn more.

## What this website does?

It is a way to show what I do with a portfolio and a simple way to send me an email.
